UdaConnect Architecture decsription

1. New Micro service person and location
The UdaConnect monolit is split in two backend micro services. One micro service handels 
the person data and the other one the location data. Both services have still a REST API 
because they should be easyly accessible via the frontend.
In this implementation they use still the same database for this MVP and this can/must be 
split in the future.
My hypotetical assumption is that business wants to see a statistic in a data warehouse (DW)
how often for a person the connections should be shown. For that reason this information 
about person id and date in put into a Kafka queue. This means the processing of this
information can be done asynchronously.

2. DW Proxy
This component reads the Kafka queued data and calls via gRPC the data warehouse system.
gRPC is used because it is an internal connection and data warehouse supports this interface.

3. DW
The data warehouse consumes the data via gRPC.
